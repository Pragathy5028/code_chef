// Chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym.
// The monthly cost of the gym is XX and personal training will cost him an additional Y per month.
// Chef's total budget per month is only Z.
// Print 1 if Chef can only join the gym, 
// 2 if he can also have a personal trainer, 
// and 0 if he can't even join the gym.
// Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer,
// he must join the gym â€” he cannot hire the trainer without joining the gym.
